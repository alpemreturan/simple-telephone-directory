Learning Outcomes: 
• Using the binary search tree 
• Developing algorithms for adding, deleting, and searching for nodes 
• Comparative data editing 
• In-order traversal on the tree 
Features that should be in the application: 
• Each person: name (string), phone number (string) 
• Commands: 
o add → Add new person 
o delete → Delete person 
o search → Search person by name 
o list → List alphabetically 
o exit → End the program 
• Adding people with the same name should not be allowed
